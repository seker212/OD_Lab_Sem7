In pyqt5 you can use:

    convert to none-executable python file :

    pyuic5 -o pyfilename.py design.ui

    convert to executable python file :

    pyuic5 -x -o pyfilename.py design.ui

and also for resource diles(qrc):

    convert qrc to python file :

    pyrcc5 -o pyfilename.py res.qrc

Note: that if you run the command in the wrong way,your ui file will be lost.So you have to make a copy of your files:)
